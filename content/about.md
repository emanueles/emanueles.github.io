I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://portal.dc.ufc.br/) at the [Universidade Federal do Ceará](http://www.ufc.br), in Brazil. In 2024, I am in [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre) at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France, with the [Aviz](https://aviz.fr/) group for a sabbatical.

I usually teach a [Data Visualization course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomBG50UAP0mPI_8F43pf6v-4pw2Jtaoi) for undergraduate and graduate students and a [Numerical Methods course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomBG50UAP0m9ukqkap2GqlPXOBUq8FaL) for undergraduate students only.
        
My research interests include data visualization and data science.

I was the Chief Scientist of Public Safety of the State Government of Ceará from 2020 to 2022. The [Chief Scientist](https://www.funcap.ce.gov.br/programas-de-auxilio/cientista-chefe-geral/) is a great program run by [Funcap](https://www.funcap.ce.gov.br/) to unite the scientists in the universities with strategic organs in the State government. 

I’ve got a PhD in Computing at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu), in 2010. Previously, I’ve got a B.S and an M.S degree in Computer Science from Universidade Federal do Ceará, in Brazil.

I was one of the main developers of [VisTrails](http://www.vistrails.org) and [crowdLabs](http://www.crowdlabs.org).

I have also worked at the [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](http://www.sci.utah.edu) at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu) with Professors [Cláudio Silva](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/claudio-silva) and [Juliana Freire](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juliana-freire) (both now working at [NYU](https://engineering.nyu.edu/)) and I was also an intern at [Los Alamos National Lab](http://www.lanl.gov). I am also a former [fulbrighter](http://www.iie.org/Fulbright/).
