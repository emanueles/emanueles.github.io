## Abstract

The evaluation of user experience in visual analytics systems is a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands a specialized approach. Traditional user experience measurement tools, including standardized questionnaires, often fail to capture the unique interactions and cognitive demands of visual analytics environments. In this position paper, we argue that it is necessary to develop a new measurement tool specifically tailored to user experience in visual analytics systems. We explore the relationship between user experience and usability and review current methods for collecting, measuring, and analyzing user experience data. We discuss the limitations of existing methods for user experience evaluations of visual analytics systems with a focus on the problematic use of current user experience questionnaires. Our research agenda outlines the key challenges for developing a dedicated evaluation instrument and proposes strategies for exploring the dimensions of user experience relevant to the visual analytics systems context. In particular, future research on a framework for developing robust and context-appropriate measurement tools that target the many important dimensions of user experience with visual analytics systems is needed.
