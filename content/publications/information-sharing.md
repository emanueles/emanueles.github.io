## Abstract
Scientists are beginning to utilize wikis, mashups, blogs and other Web 2.0 technologies as a means to improve collabora- tion and information sharing. The term Science 2.0 has been used to refer to emerging scientific applications that make use of these Web 2.0 technologies. In this paper we discuss the benefits and opportunities that come from Science 2.0 as well as the challenges involved in building Science 2.0 applications.
