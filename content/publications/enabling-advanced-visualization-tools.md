## Abstract
Simulations that require massive amounts of computing power and generate tens of terabytes of data are now part of the daily lives of scientists. Analyzing and visualizing the results of these simulations as they are computed can lead not only to early insights but also to useful knowledge that can be provided as feedback to the simulation, avoiding unnecessary use of computing power. Our work is aimed at making advanced visualization tools available to scientists in a user-friendly, web-based environ- ment where they can be accessed anytime from anywhere.
In the context of turbulent combustion for example, visualization is used to understand the coupling between turbulence and the turbulent mixing of scalars. Although isosurface generation is a useful technique in this scenario, computing and rendering isosurfaces one at a time is expensive and not particularly well-suited for such a web- based framework. In this paper we propose the use of a summary structure, called contour tree, that captures the topological structure of a scalar field and guides the user in identifying useful isosurfaces. We have also designed an interface which has been integrated with a web-based simulation monitoring system, that allows users to interact with and explore multiple isosurfaces.
