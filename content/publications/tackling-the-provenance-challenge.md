## Abstract

VisTrails is a new workflow and provenance management system that
provides support for scientific data exploration and
visualization. Whereas workflows have been traditionally used to
automate repetitive tasks, for applications that are exploratory in
nature, change is the norm. VisTrails uses a new change-based
provenance mechanism which was designed to handle rapidly-evolving
workflows. It uniformly and automatically captures provenance
information for data products and for the evolution of the workflows
used to generate these products. In this paper, we describe how the
VisTrails provenance data is organized in layers and present a first
approach for querying this data that we developed to tackle the
Provenance Challenge queries.
