# VisTrails

[VisTrails](http://www.vistrails.org) is an open-source scientific workflow and provenance management system hosted at NYU-Poly that provides support for data exploration and visualization. A key distinguishing feature of VisTrails is a comprehensive provenance infrastructure that maintains detailed history information about the steps followed and data derived in the course of an exploratory task: VisTrails maintains provenance of data products, of the workflows that derive these products and their executions.
