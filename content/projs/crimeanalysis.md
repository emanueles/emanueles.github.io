# Using Visualization and Data Mining Tools for Crime Data Analysis

In this project we are integrating Visualization and Data Mining Tools to analyze crime data.

The first technique we developed in the project is MSKDE - Marching Squares Kernel Density Estimation. It generates fast and accurate hotspot maps. MSKDE is described in the [paper](/publications/mskde-using-marching-squares-to-quickly-make-high-quality/) published in SIBGRAPI.
