# Using Visualization and Data Mining Tools for Crime Data Analysis

In this project, we are integrating Visualization and Data Mining Tools to analyze crime data.

The first technique we developed in the project is MSKDE - Marching Squares Kernel Density Estimation. It generates fast and accurate hotspot maps. MSKDE is described in the [paper](/publications/mskde-using-marching-squares-to-quickly-make-high-quality/) published in SIBGRAPI. 

We also worked together with domain experts from police agencies of two different countries to identify and characterize five domain tasks inherent to the hotspot analysis problem and developed [SHOC, a visualization tool](/publications/a-visual-analytics-approach-to-facilitate-crime-hotspot/) that strives for simplicity and ease of use in helping users to perform all the domain tasks.
